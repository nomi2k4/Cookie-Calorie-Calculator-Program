Cookie Calorie Calculator Program:
This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates the total calories consumed based on the number of cookies eaten.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input the number of cookies eaten
- Calculates the total calories consumed based on the assumption that each cookie has 75 calories
- Displays the result

Features:

- User input for number of cookies eaten
- Use of multiplication operator for calorie calculation
- Clear and informative output

Assumptions:

- 1 bag of cookies = 40 cookies
- 1 bag of cookies = 10 servings
- 1 serving = 4 cookies
- 1 serving = 300 calories
- 1 cookie = 75 calories (calculated from above assumptions)

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./cookie_calorie_calculator
    - On Windows: cookie_calorie_calculator.exe
4. Enter the number of cookies eaten when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using integer variables and arithmetic operators
- Working with basic calculations and assumptions
- Basic program structure and syntax
